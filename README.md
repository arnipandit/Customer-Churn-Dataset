# Customer-Churn-Dataset
📌 Project Overview: Customer Churn Dashboard
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data for a telecom company and visualizing key insights through an interactive dashboard. The goal is to identify churn patterns and provide actionable insights to reduce customer attrition and improve business decisions.

🔍 Key Objectives:
Understand the distribution and rate of customer churn.

Analyze the impact of customer demographics, tenure, internet service, and payment methods on churn behavior.

Visualize important business metrics such as revenue lost, average tenure, and total churned customers.

Provide business stakeholders with a clear, interactive dashboard for monitoring churn and related KPIs.

📊 Dashboard Features and Insights:
💸 Revenue Lost & Churn Rate
A total of $139.13K revenue has been lost due to churn.

The overall churn rate is 27%, which is significant and requires attention.

🧍‍♂️ Customer Segmentation & Churn Behavior
Senior citizens exhibit a higher churn proportion compared to non-seniors.

Churn distribution shows a substantial portion of customers have left, as seen in the donut chart.

🌐 Internet Service Impact
Customers with Fiber Optic and DSL services show higher churn compared to those without internet service.

Fiber optic users contribute heavily to churn, possibly indicating dissatisfaction or higher expectations.

💳 Payment Method Insights
Electronic Check users have the highest churn rate, indicating potential issues with trust or flexibility.

Customers paying via Credit Card or Bank Transfer (automatic) tend to stay longer, possibly due to convenience or commitment.

⏳ Tenure Analysis
Many customers churn at very early stages (0–5 months), and there is a visible spike at around 70–80 months.

Long-term customers nearing the 6–7 year mark may leave due to pricing, changing needs, or competitive offers.

👨‍👩‍👧 Gender-Based Filtering
The dashboard includes filters for Male, Female, and All, allowing deeper demographic-specific insights for churn strategies.
